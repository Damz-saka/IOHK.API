The API exercise has been completed using java lang with
selenium and on a build of maven project with testNG method

There are three classes which are:
1. A GET request of a list of users with few validations to check
the responses returned by the API.
   
2. A POST request to create a user and send to the server then assert
that the data passed is same as the response returned by the API.
   
3. A POST request of unsuccessful user registration using a different
method to test case two but achieving the same goal with assertions to
check that data passed correspond to the returned response of the API.
